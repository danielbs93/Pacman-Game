# Description
In this project we built the game Pacman in html + js+ jQuery + css.

The goal of the game is to accumulate as many points as you can by eating balls in 3 different degrees 5/15/25 points,
while escaping from the monsters.
The game end after the pre-defined game time is over or after five times the monsters got you.
You won the game if you got all the balls, or you collected more than 100 points when time ran out

More functionality:
- Eating Strawberry adds 50 points
- Eating a clock adds half a minute to the game time
- Eating heart adds another round of play
